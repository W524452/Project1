## Introduction 

The "learning facilitator" frequently describes options for lunch, as there is nothing on the WAES site about it. This information could be provided on a website instead, allowing the audience to inform themselves in advance about lunchtime options, and providing a wider range of information.

## Purpose

To inform the audience about lunchtime options.

## Target Audience

Students at WAES

## Initial Design

### Layout

### Colours

#### Colour psychology

Green is restful, Yellow is happy

use Mycolor.Space [sic] to find a reasonable set of palette colours

test colour combinations to rule out combinations with poor contrast

#### Accessibility

Foreground colours need to have high contrast to background colours to be accessible.
